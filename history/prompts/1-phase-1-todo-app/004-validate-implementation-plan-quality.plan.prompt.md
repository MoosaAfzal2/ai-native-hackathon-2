## Prompt

/sp.checklist

Generate a comprehensive quality checklist to validate the implementation plan.

Create checklist items to validate:

REQUIREMENTS COVERAGE:
- All 5 basic features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete) are addressed in the plan
- Each feature has clear implementation steps
- Architecture supports all specified functionality
- No required features are missing from the plan

TECHNICAL COMPLETENESS:
- Project structure is clearly defined
- All necessary files and modules are identified
- Technology stack is fully specified (Python 3.13+, UV, etc.)
- Dependencies are listed and justified
- OOP architecture is properly designed (Models, Storage, UI layers)

PLAN CLARITY:
- Implementation steps are specific and actionable
- No ambiguous terms or vague instructions
- File paths and module names are explicit
- Relationships between components are clear
- Entry points and main flows are documented

CONSTITUTION ALIGNMENT:
- Plan respects all Constitution standards
- Type hints strategy is defined
- Code formatting strategy is defined
- Docstring requirements are addressed
- Error handling approach is specified
- Code quality standards are integrated
- UV package manager usage is confirmed

ARCHITECTURE QUALITY:
- Separation of concerns is maintained
- Single Responsibility Principle is followed
- Proper encapsulation in models
- Clear interfaces between layers
- Testable design patterns
- Test coverage is high for business logic

IMPLEMENTATION FEASIBILITY:
- No over-engineering for Phase I scope
- Realistic for in-memory storage
- Console UI approach is straightforward
- No unnecessary complexity
- Foundation supports future phases

DOCUMENTATION PLANS:
- README.md structure is defined
- Setup instructions will be included
- Usage examples will be provided

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implementation plan validated and approved; all quality criteria met; ready to proceed to task generation
- 🧪 Tests: Checklist serves as quality validation gate; 100% pass rate indicates plan is complete and ready
- 📁 Files: Created `implementation_plan.md` checklist with 74 validation items across 15 categories
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.tasks` to generate detailed task breakdown with step-by-step TDD specifications
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan is comprehensive, Constitutional-compliant, unambiguous, and implementable. All requirements from spec are addressed. All TDD, OOP, and quality standards integrated. Ready for development team.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all 74 checklist items passing
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - 100% of validation criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - comprehensive plan validation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to `/sp.tasks` for detailed task generation; implementation team can begin development based on comprehensive task specifications
